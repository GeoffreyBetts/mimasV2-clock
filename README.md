# mimasV2-clock
This is a simple project to practice FPGA programming with verilog. It will be a 12 hour clock with am/pm display.\
As devkit only contains 3 7-seg displays, will need an alternate display method; possibly an LCD display.\
Programming is done using Xilinx ISE WebPACK 14.7.

## Specifications
- [x] Generate a 1Hz clock signal
- [x] Count a clock signal in a hh:mm:ss format
- [x] Have an alternating am/pm signal when the time rolls over
- [ ] Display the time on an output device
- [ ] Ability to pause and input a new time

## Hardware
